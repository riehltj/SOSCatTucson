        SOS Cat Rescue AZ, Inc. is a foster-based, volunteer-run 501(c)(3), no
        kill, non-profit animal rescue group based out of Tucson, AZ dedicated
        to saving orphan kittens and senior cats from shelters across Arizona
        and giving them a second chance for a “happily ever after” life by
        matching adoptable kitties to the right homes. All cats are solely
        placed in foster homes where they will be taken care of according to
        their individual needs such as bottle feeding for orphans, socialization
        for kittens while growing up, medical attention to the sick, and hospice
        care for seniors.
      </p>

    <div class="purple-bg">
      <p>
        Since all our cats live in foster homes, we get to know them, their
        behavior, and their needs very well so we can help you find the cat that
        is a match for you.

        SOS stands for Saving Orphans and Seniors and is founded by experienced
        Tucson based rescuers who focus on special-need-cats and their
        well-being. Our team consists of excellent foster families, specialized
        bottle-feeders with years of experience, as well as strong individuals
        with a loving heart for senior cats, their special needs, and the
        knowledge that most of our seniors are with us because of their
        deteriorating health. This means we give senior cats a loving hospice
        forever home where they can pass over in a home situation, loved and
        cared for.

        Our goals are to rescue orphaned kittens and senior cats in need,
        provide them with the care they need, and find them wonderful homes and
        a place to live out their remaining days. We are also working hard at
        screening the potential families and asking the right questions to
        ensure every single one of our rescued kitties finds their happily ever
        after home.

        Throughout the year, we are raising funds to pay for all medical care we
        provide to our foster cats. We will let you know about our fundraising
        event right here and hope you are willing to support our cause.
