      <h1>A FEW MEOWS ABOUT US</h1>
      <p>
        SOS Cat Rescue AZ, Inc is a foster-based, volunteer-run, no kill,
        non-profit animal rescue group based out of Tucson AZ. The organization
        is dedicated to saving orphan kittens and senior cats from shelters
        across Arizona and giving them a second chance at a happily ever after.

      <h1>VOLUNTEER YOUR TIME</h1>
      <p>
        Have you thought about ways you can help animals in need but are not
        ready to adopt? Why not give fostering a try then. You get to enjoy a
        wonderful pet without the financial obligations of adopting and who
        knows, you may end up adopting him/her. Many foster families do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fostering is a temporary commitment and it means you provide the safety
        and love of your home and your family and we provide all the medical
        care if needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fostering for SOS means that we provide all preâ€“approved medical care
        which includes vaccinations, spay/neuter surgeries, and treatment for
        any medical issues that the cat in your car may have. SOS will also
        support you every step of the way with our network of experienced
        fosters.
      </p>

        We realize you might not be able to adopt one of our cats but would like
        to help them out. You can become a sponsor for just a few dollars per
        month. Your donation helps to pay for the basic needs of each cat for
        the duration of his or her stay with us. You can follow their stories
        via our Facebook page
        <span
          ><a href="https://www.facebook.com/SOSCatRescueAZ/"
            >SOScatrescueAZ</a
          ></span
        >
        where we will give updates with current photos and stories.
