        At SOS, we cannot do what we do without the help of people like you! We
        always seek committed foster homes to help save even more lives. Every
        cat at SOS is placed into a foster home to receive all the one-on-one
        love, medical attention, and socialization they need. The number of
        lives we can save is limited by the number of foster homes we have.
      </p>
      <p>
        Have you thought about ways you can help animals in need but are not
        ready to adopt? Why not give fostering a try then. You get to enjoy a
        wonderful pet without the financial obligations of adopting and who
        knows, you may end up adopting him/her. Many foster families do.

      <h1>why do cat need foster care?</h1>
      <ul class="bulleted-list">
        There are several possible reasons:

        <li>Foster care can help save lives when a shelter is full.</li>
        <li>
          Some cats don’t do well in a shelter environment (they are scared or
          need a little extra care).
        </li>
        <li>
          Newborn kittens need to be nursed or bottle-fed usually by foster
          parents.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some cats just need time to recover from an illness or injury before
          adoption.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Whatever the individual reason, these cats need some extra love and care
        before they can be adopted. Providing foster care for a few days, weeks,
        or months can be a lifesaving gift for an animal.
      </p>

      <h1>temporary commitment</h1>
      <p>
        Fostering is a temporary commitment and it means you provide the safety
        and love of your home and your family and we provide all the medical
        care if needed. Unfortunately, we are unable to predict/guarantee the
        length of a foster cat’s stay; the typical lengths for cats/kittens in
        foster care varies anywhere from 4 to 12 weeks (sometimes longer). The
        length varies based on many factors such as medical condition, waiting
        for a suitable adopter and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        In case of fostering hospice cats, the length is not predictable and the
        outcome is the passing of the foster cat. We don’t want to color this,
        these cats are the toughest since they are loving and appreciative of
        being out of the shelter, but at the same time, their medical condition
        is not prognosed to improve.

    <div class="purple-bg">
      <h1>Vets, meets, and greets</h1>
      <p>
        In return, we ask that you make your foster cat available for vet
        appointments and meet-and-greets. We also ask that you provide us with
        pictures and information about your foster cat’s personality so we can
        post them on our website, Petfinder, and Facebook. Photos and videos
        combined with compelling stories increase the cat’s chance to find a
        home!
      </p>

      <p>
        If the time comes and you may decide that you simply cannot part with
        your foster cat or kitten, you’re welcome to “foster fail.” This is the
        best kind of “failure” you will ever experience since you are only
        “failing” your foster cat on the promise to find him or her a new home
        by adopting him or her yourself into your home (the place the cat
        already knows and loves!).
