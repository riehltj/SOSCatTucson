        Please make a difference today by clicking on the PayPal donation button
        below and making your secure donation online. All SOS cats say meow
        which in this case means “Thank you!”

      <p>We also accept your kind donations by check to:</p>
      <p>SOS Cat Rescue AZ, P.O.Box 35002, Tucson, AZ 85740-5002</p>
      <p>
        Or call one of our rescue veterinarian offices to donate directly into
        our medical accounts:
      </p>
      <p>Pet DoctoRX via (520) 829-5166, medical account #5149</p>
      <p>
        Twin Peaks Veterinary Center via (520) 572-8300 (just mention SOS Cat
        Rescue AZ)
      </p>

      <p>
        How does your donation help us? For example: $15 buys a bottle of
        antibiotics for a cat who has an upper-respiratory, $10 buys a
        life-saving distemper vaccine, $25 buys a microchip for a cat who will
        find his or her way back to us if he or she ever gets lost or abandoned.
        These are just a few examples, please remember that the tiniest and
        oldest are most of the time the ones with the highest medical expenses.

        We are aware that some of our senior cats, for whatever reasons – old
        age, trauma, or medical problems – will stay longer in our care or might
        even never be adopted. These kitties are cherished and loved and we want
        to be able to provide the best care for them. We promise every cat that
        comes into our care that he or she would never have to worry again about
        having enough food, finding a warm bed to snuggle into, or finding a
        caring human to give them lots of love, attention, and the medical
        assistance they need.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, we also realize you might not be able to adopt one of our
        cats but would like to help them out. You can become a sponsor for just
        a few dollars per month. Your donation helps to pay for the basic needs
        of each cat for the duration of his or her stay with us. You can follow
        their stories via our
        <span
          ><a href="https://www.facebook.com/SOSCatRescueAZ/">Facebook</a>

        SOS Cat Rescue AZ is an all-volunteer, nonprofit organization
        incorporated in the State of Arizona in 2015. We receive no government
        funding and all donations are 100% tax-deductible as allowed by law. SOS
        Cat Rescue AZ is recognized as exempt by the IRS under Section
        501(c)(3).

        IRS Determination Letter. We are committed to fiscal responsibility and
        transparency.
      </p>
      <p>
        All monetary donations go directly and exclusively towards veterinary
        care, medication, and supplies for the kittens and cats in our care. We
        are funded exclusively by donations from dedicated animal lovers,
        generous supporters, and adoption fees; and regardless of how small a
        cash donation is, it helps SOS to continue to take in orphan kittens and
        senior cats as well as cats of all ages in hospice situations. The funds
        are exclusively used to provide our cats with the individual care they
        need until they find their forever homes or the hospice seniors pass
        over the rainbow bridge.
